# Why? 
-   These are design patterns that deal with the creation of objects. In some specific circumstances or constraints.

* (how does an object come into existence) -> patterns that address how to create objects of classes.
- Is new Obj() the only way?

# Use Cases 
1. Singleton 
2. Builder
3. Prototype
4. Factory
